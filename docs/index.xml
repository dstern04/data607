      <description>Chapter 1 - Introduction to Data Learning Objectives  Identify the type of variables (e.g. numerical or categorical; discrite or continuous; ordered or not ordered). Identify the relationship between multiple variables (i.e. indepedent vs. dependent). Define variables that are not associated as independent. Be able to describe and identify the difference between observational and experimental studies. Distinguish between simple random, stratified, and cluster sampling, and recognize the benefits and drawbacks of choosing one sampling scheme over another.</description>

      <description>Chapter 2 Learning Outcomes  Define trial, outcome, and sample space. Define and describe the law of large numbers. Distinguish disjoint (also called mutually exclusive) and independent events. Use Venn diagrams to represent events and their probabilities. Describe probability distributions. Distinguish between marginal and conditional probabilities. Use tree diagrams and/or Bayes Theorem to calculate conditional probabilities and probabilities of intersection of non-independent events. The expected value of a discrete random variable is computed by adding each outcome weighted by its probability.</description>

      <description>The solutions to the practice problems are at the end of the book and do not need to be handed in. Graded assignments should be typed (preferably using R Markdown) or neatly hand written and scanned. Data for the homework assignments, and for within the chapters too, can be downloaded here.

 Practice: Graded:  Labs The labs are available in the DATA606 R package. To start the first lab, use the startLab function. This will copy the lab to your current working directory and rename the file according to your computer username (as returend by Sys.info()[&#39;user&#39;]). If this is incorrect, then either provide the file-prefix parameter to startLab, or rename the file after it has been copied.</description>

      <description>These mini projects will have you explore statistical topics using R. You can use the startLab function in the DATA606 package to get started, or copy the templates from the links below. Please submit a PDF (preferred) or HTML file along with your Rmarkdown file. Be sure to answer all questions in lab, not just the on your own section. Labs can be submitted on Blackboard.

      <description>Occasionally you will need to type equations in homework and labs. R Markdown supports LaTeX style equations using the MathJax javascript library. I do not expect you to learn LaTeX for this course. Instead, I recommend using the free application [Daum Equation Editor](). It availabe online, as a Google Chrome Extension, or as a standalone Mac Application.

      <guid>/post/2017-08-25-getting-started-with-r/</guid>
      <description>To get started with the labs, you will need to install R and other supporting applications. Links to download all the software is on the Software page at http://data606.net/software which is available on the Misc menu. Once you are in RStudio, you will need to install a number of R packages using the following two commands:
install.packages(c(&amp;#39;openintro&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;OIdata&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;devtools&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;ggplot2&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;psych&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;reshape2&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;knitr&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;markdown&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;shiny&amp;#39;)) devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;jbryer/DATA606&amp;quot;) Note that this course used to be listed as IS 606, hence the different package name.</description>

      <description>Welcome to DATA606! My name is Dr. Jason Bryer and I will be your instructor for this semester. In addition to teaching this course, I am an Executive Director at Excelsior College where I am currently working on a Department of Education grant to develop a Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (see www.DAACS.net for more information). Our first meeting will be on Tuesday, August 29th, but will typically be on Wednesdays for the rest of the semester.</description>
